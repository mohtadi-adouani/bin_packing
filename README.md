# bin_packing
In operations research and combinatorial optimization, bin packing is an algorithmic problem. It is about storing objects with a minimum number of boxes. The classic problem is defined in one dimension, but there are many variants in two or three dimensions.

We use IBM ILOG CPLEX in C.
